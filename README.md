Type of customers
Subscribers:pay yearly fee/monthly fee, first 45 minutes free and $3/15 minutes after 45 minutes.
Customers:$2 for the first 30 minutes and $3/15 minutes after 30 minutes.

Through using ggplot, I want to visualize the FordGoBike usage pattern(peak hour, riding durations) between subscribers and customers 
on weekdays and weekends.
