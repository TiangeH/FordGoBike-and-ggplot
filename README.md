# FordGoBike-and-ggplot
Through using ggplot, I want to visualize the FordGoBike usage pattern(peak hour, riding durations) between subscribers and customers 
on weekdays and weekends. 

The data I am using is 2017-06-28 to 2017-12-31 bike usage data from FordGoBike's website. (https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html).
